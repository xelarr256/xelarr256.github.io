			<h1>Critical Log</h1>
			<h2>Web Standards: My Website</h2>
			<p>My website makes use of many web standards. 
			Examples of these in the html portion include the use of relevant and necessary tags to keep the code structured.
			This includes giving pages names and declaring charsets along with similar things.
			These pieces of code are made to fully adhere to the w3c recommendations which includes a set of rules meant to standardise and validate the html of webpages.
			While building my website I have also attempted to comply with the w3c CSS standards. 
			This has been partially completed as there are no errors and it validates as CSS level 3+ SVG.
			However, there are still many warnings.
			My JavaScript was also standardised to a degree by naming functions and variables according to their purpose.</p>
			<p>Functionally, the website performs correctly on Firefox, Edge and IE. 
			Chrome struggles with an issue with the customizer meaning that part of the site doesn’t work on that browser.
			All browsers struggle with a tiny screen size and this is most apparent on the customizer page which is inoperable on screens smaller than around 1200 pixels. 
			The only browser specific commands present are in the CSS where they are used to build the circles featured on the home page.
			To make the site usable on smaller screens I used CSS media queries to include and exclude portions of CSS depending on the size of the screen.</p>
			<h2>Web Standards: Old vs New</h2>
			<p>The web standards in use for HTML currently are HTML 5.
			These web standards hold many advantages over the previous HTML 4 standards. 
			Firstly, the current standards include a larger amount of tags for use.
			This allows for a better structure and can also affect how well the page fits together.
			In addition to this many existing elements were given now attributes to more easily specify how to make the html behave. 
			Some existing attributes were also edited often to validate the inputs they were receiving and some to support new values.
			The newest standards will always have an issue though: browser support.
			Depending on the user’s browser of choice it may not support HTML 5 especially if it’s an older browser.</p>
			<p>The web standards for CSS as of present are CSS3.
			The version prior to this was CSS2.
			CSS3 includes many more new properties than CSS2 allowing the programmer to more accurately and more easily achieve the design they want.
			Media queries are also a part of current standards meaning the site can be more easily developed for different devices.
			Web pages are also more easily divided using columns.
			The style of the webpage can also be changed using few lines of programming leading to faster load times.
			One problem with introducing any new standards is that all the users of previous standards must relearn the new standards which can take time and money.
			CSS3 may also have problems being compatible with multiple browsers.</p>
			<h2>W3C Validation</h2>
			<p>Evidence showing that no errors are present when validating in accordance to the w3c web standards.
			Changes along the way include declaring a doctype for my html pages and giving all my images an alt name.</p>

			<h2>Customiser Page</h2>
			<img alt="File Structure" src="Assets/FileStructure.png">
			<p>When building the website, it is important to keep the structure of the files in order.
			I have done that using appropriately named folders.
			This makes linking and sourcing files very easy as it’s obvious where they will be stored.
			It also means other people could work with the files without much explaining.</p>

			<p>Evidence of web pages being correctly displayed in Firefox, Chrome, Edge and IE.</p>
			<h2>Evidence of Mark-up Practices</h2>
			<img alt="Code Evidence" src="Assets/MarkUpEvidence.png">
			<p>This example of code includes many pieces of good structuring.
			The first thing is that a doctype is declared to allow the page to be correctly built. 
			The charset is also declared to specify the character encoding.
			The scripts are all linked in the head and the page is given a title for external viewing.
			The image featured is given alternate text in case it fails to load. 
			The code is correctly indented for easy reading.</p>
